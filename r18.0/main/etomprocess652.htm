	<h3>Description</h3>
              
	<p>Service Level Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Service Level Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Service Level Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:
http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx
Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Service Catalog Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
The Service Level Manager is responsible for keeping up to date with the current and future service requirements of customers.  They also ensure that Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Service Level Reports (SLRs) are kept up to date and are a true reflection of the business requirements.  This process also looks at complaints, plaudits and customer satisfaction.

•Terminology•
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Customer – eTOM end-user
ITIL Service – eTOM CFS and RFS distinction
ITIL SLA – eTOM Customer QoS/SLAITIL SLO – eTOM Service Quality ITIL Underpinning Contract  – referred in eTOM as ‘agreed commercial arrangements between the service provider and the other parties involved.

•Linkage with eTOM process areas•
ITIL Service Level Management relates to several eTOM process areas.  The eTOM processes affected include: Within Operations:
Process Identifier: 1.1.1.7 
Process Element: Customer QoS/SLA Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes operate in line with this. Monitoring, managing and reporting of delivered vs. contractual Quality of Service (QoS), as defined in the enterprise’s service descriptions, customer contracts or product catalogue is within the scope of ITIL Service Level Management.
Process Identifier: 1.1.2.4 
Process Element: Service Quality Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Quality Management processes operate in line with this. Managing, tracking, monitoring, analyzing, improving and reporting on the performance of specific services is within the scope of ITIL Service Level Management.
Process Identifier: 1.1.3.4 
Process Element: Resource Performance Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Performance Management processes operate in line with this. Setting the proper level of Service Level Objectives in accordance to established upper Service Level Agreements based upon relevant resource performance.
Process Identifier: 
Process Element: Party Performance Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Party Performance Management processes operate in line with this. Setting the proper level of the Underpinning Contracts  in accordance to established upper Service Level Agreements.
Within Strategy, Infrastructure & Product
Process Identifier: 1.2.1.3 
Process Element: Product & Offer Capability Delivery
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Product & Offer Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this. Determine Product Requirements to support the proper level of services performance.
Process Identifier: 1.2.2 
Process Element: Service Development & Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Development & Management processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:
Service Capability Delivery: ensure that enough Service Capability is in place in order to achieve Service Level Objectives
Process Identifier: 1.2.3 
Process Element: Resource Development & Management
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Development & Management processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:
Resource Capability Delivery: ensure that enough Resource Capability is in place in order to achieve Service Level Objectives
Process Identifier: 1.2.4 
Process Element:  Party Offering Development & Retirement
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Service Level Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Party Offering Development & Retirement processes operate in line with this. Ensure that Supply chain is developed in accordance with the established Service Level objectives.
