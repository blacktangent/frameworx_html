<BODY>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Tactical Planning is responsible for the detailed 
design of resource against the existing networked resource at all technology 
layers, ensuring that the designed resource is actually deployed and for 
accurately recording the resultant inventory. At the physical layer, this will 
involve deploying devices and connections between devices. Further Application 
Map applications are also required in order to test the resource on installation 
and to project manages the supply chain in order to deploy the planned resource. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>At higher technology layers, Tactical Planning is 
responsible for detailed logical network design and implementation at the 
technology layers using input from Strategic Planning. It is also responsible 
for traffic engineering the capacity of the logical network, taking input from 
Performance Management. The output of Tactical Planning at the higher technology 
layers is often to network provisioning systems, which are used to implement the 
required logical connections into the bearer network.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Data Center and server farms are planned and deployed 
and capacity managed using the same Tactical Planning functions as used for 
resource.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Tactical planning is responsible for purchasing 
network equipment, usually through purchasing control systems and into the 
Enterprise Resource Management systems of suppliers. This is ideally achieved 
through Business-to-business (B2B) portals, both for operational efficiency and 
data integrity. Supply Chain Management controls this interaction. Standards 
such as from RosettaNet Telecommunications Industry Council are being developed 
to support electronic purchasing of telecoms equipment. RosettaNet are partnered 
with the TMF for this purpose.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A major role for Tactical Planning is to implement 
Strategic Plans, deploying specific devices and device connections at and 
between strategic locations. Tactical Planning also supports reactive planning, 
which involves the deployment of network capacity in response to immediate 
demands. It includes the following planning activities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>These functions are primarily supported in inventory 
based capacity management systems where decisions are made and device specific 
designs are captured against an inventory of the existing, deployed and utilized 
network. Such systems are typically large scale as they are operated by planners 
across the entire geography of the network and ideally by planners responsible 
for all network and IT technologies, so a single, common inventory of the 
network is created. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Tactical Planning requires an accurate inventory of 
the network as a whole and detailed device modeling. It results in a master 
reference inventory of the planned networked resource against the inventory of 
deployed networked resource.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT></P></UL><FONT size=2 face=Arial>However, it 
is entirely expected that such systems may be federated along lines such as 
geography, technology and network vendor. This will ease the inventory 
management problem and enable the conflict-free, long-term transactions required 
by planning applications. Federation in this way must also support interworking 
and dependencies between the resulting management domains.</FONT>
