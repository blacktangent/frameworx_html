	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Availability Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspxIts role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Availability Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.The Availability Manager is responsible for ensuring the current Service is performing to its availability targets as well as ensuring that new services are designed to deliver the availability levels required by the business.  The Availability Manager will help to specify what the reliability, maintainability and serviceability of a new service should be.•Terminology•Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Service – eTOM CFS and RFS distinctionITIL Incident – eTOM ProblemITIL Problem – eTOM QoS•Linkage with eTOM process areas•ITIL Availability Management relates to several eTOM process areas.  The eTOM processes affected include: Within Operations: Process Identifier: 1.1.1.1 Process Element: Customer-Ops Support & ReadinessProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Support & Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Support Customer QoS/SLA Managementproduct availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.1.1.7 Process Element: Customer QoS/SLA ManagementProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Report Customer QoS PerformanceCreate Customer QoS Performance Degradation Report: product availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.1.2.1 Process Element: Service-Ops Support & ReadinessProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service-Ops Support & Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Enable Service Quality Management: service availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.1.3.1 Process Element: Resource-Ops Support & ReadinessProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource-Ops Support & Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Enable Resource Performance Management: resource availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsWithin Strategy, Infrastructure & ProductProcess Identifier: 1.2.1.3 Process Element: Product & Offer Capability DeliveryProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Product & Offer Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Manage handover to Product OperationsDefine Product Capability RequirementsCapture Product Capability ShortfallsManage Product Capability Delivery MethodologyProduct availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.2.2.2Process Element: Service Capability DeliveryProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Map & Analyze Service RequirementsDesign Service CapabilitiesCapture Service Capability ShortfallsEnable Service Support & OperationsManage handover to Service OperationsService availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.2.2.3Process Element: Service Development & RetirementProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Development & Retirement processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Develop Detailed Service SpecificationsAssess Performance of existing ServicesService availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.2.3.2 Process Element: Resource Capability DeliveryProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Map & Analyze Resource RequirementsEnable Resource Support & OperationsCapture Resource Capability ShortfallsDesign Resource CapabilityManage Resource Capability DeliveryResource availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trendsProcess Identifier: 1.2.2.1Process Element: Service Strategy & PlanningProcess Impact:Where ITIL Availability Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Strategy & Planning processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are:Gather and Analyze Service InformationEstablish Service Strategy & GoalsService availability is measured, analyzed and reported in accordance to the defined/expected QoS/SLA; actions are planned and initiated for corrective actions; improvements are planned according to forecasts and trends.
