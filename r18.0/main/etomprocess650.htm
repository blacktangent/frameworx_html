	<p>Change Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned.

	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Change Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:
http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx
Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Change Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Change Management optimizes risk exposure, minimize any business disruption and to ensure that anything released into the live environment goes right the first time.  With these as the drivers Change Management should reduce risk and therefore deliver direct benefit to the business.
Change Management aims to ensure that all changes to the IT infrastructure are assessed and enacted in a controlled manner, i.e.:
Standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes
All changes to service assets and configuration items are recorded in the Configuration Management System
Overall business risk is optimized.
The goals of ITIL Change Management are to:
Respond to the customer’s changing business requirements while maximizing value and reducing incidents, disruption and re-work
Respond to the business and IT requests for change that will align the services with the business needs.
The objective of the ITIL Change Management process is to ensure that changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner.

•Terminology•
There is no specific eTOM term for changes or associated ITIL terms such as change request, change record, or change advisory board.  Instead, eTOM generically refers to “changes” in various processes.  ITIL terminology includes: 
ITIL Change – The actual change that is proposed and possibly carried out is conceptually referred to as an ITIL Change.  This is the generic term, which may refer to the ITIL Change Request, ITIL Change Record, the change that is carried out, or all three.
ITIL Change Request – All changes are submitted as an ITIL Change Request, which may also be called an ITIL Request for Change. 
ITIL Change Record – After an ITIL Change Request is submitted and accepted, all documentation related to that ITIL Change Request is captured in an ITIL Change Record. • ITIL Change Advisory Board – A team that meets to assess an ITIL Change Request and recommend its authorization or rejection.• ITIL Change Authority – The individual or team that has the power to enact or reject an ITIL Change Request.  • ITIL Standard Change – A well-known type of change for which a simple, straightforward procedure can be carried out to enact the change. These changes are often expedited and do not require explicit authorization.  For example, a request to add a user to a security group may be an ITIL Standard Change.  It may also be called an ITIL Pre-approved Change.  

•Linkage with eTOM process areas•
ITIL Change Management relates to several eTOM process areas.  The eTOM processes affected include: 

Process Identifier: 1.1.2.2
Process Element: Service Configuration & Activation
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Configuration & Activation processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Service Configuration & Activation processes works with ITIL Change Management to allocate, implement, configure, and activate a service, bringing it into operation.  All of these involve IT changes that must be managed and coordinated.  

Process Identifier: 1.1.3.2
Process Element: Resource Provisioning
Process Impact: Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Provisioning processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Resource Provisioning processes work with ITIL Change Management to allocate, install, configure, and activate specific resources in support of IT services.  All of these involve IT changes that must be managed and coordinated.  

Process Identifier: 1.2.1.3
Process Element: Product & Offer Capability Delivery
Process Impact: Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Product & Offer Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Product & Offer Capability Delivery processes work with ITIL Change Management to coordinate the development of new and modified products and offerings of the business.  Because this includes changes to IT services, ITIL Change Management is involved.  Process Identifier: 1.2.2.2
Process Element: Service Capability Delivery
Process Impact:  Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Service Capability Delivery processes work with ITIL Change Management to plan and deliver changes within business services, which typically includes IT services.  

Process Identifier: 1.2.2.3
Process Element: Service Development & Retirement
Process Impact:
Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Development & Retirement processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Service Development & Retirement processes develop new and enhanced types of service, and IT services that are a part of this service are controlled and managed using ITIL Change Management.  

Process Identifier: 1.2.3.3
Process Element: Resource Development & Retirement
Process Impact: Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then Resource Development & Retirement processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Resource Development & Retirement processes develop new and enhanced types of resources to enable new services to be developed, and IT services that are a part of this service are controlled and managed using ITIL Change Management.

Process Identifier: 1.2.4.3
Process Element:  Party Offering Development & Retirement
Process Impact: Where ITIL Change Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then  Party Offering Development & Retirement processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The  Party Offering Development & Retirementprocesses manage changes in suppliers in support of a supply chain, and this is an area where ITIL Change Management can be helpful in assessing and approving changes to the supply chain of an IT service.
