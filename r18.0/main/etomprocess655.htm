	<h3>Description</h3>
              
	<p>Event Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Event Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Event Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspxIts role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Event Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.Event Management aims to detect IT infrastructure events and determine the appropriate response to them.  Not all events require a response, but some do. Some responses may be automated, although some may require manual intervention. Event Management provides the ability to detect events, to make sense of them and to determine the most suitable control activity.  This depends on monitoring but should not be considered as just that, monitoring provides information on everything, event management provides meaningful information and notifications. •Terminology•Both ITIL and eTOM use the term “event” in similar ways.  However, the term “event” needs to be used in other areas where ITIL Event Management can be integrated, including those listed in the following section.  In addition, eTOM uses the terms “problem” and “trouble” to refer to many things, including events.  This is a source of potential confusion, so the distinctions between ITIL and eTOM usage in this area should be kept in mind.•Linkage with eTOM process areas•ITIL Event Management relates to several eTOM process areas.  The eTOM processes affected include:Process Identifier: 1.1.2.3Process Element: Service Problem ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Event Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then Service Problem Management processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Service Problem Management processes respond immediately to any issues that may affect the operation of a service, including events, and ITIL Event Management works with this process to resolve events related to a service.  Process Identifier: 1.1.3.3Process Element: Resource Trouble ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Event Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then Resource Trouble Management processes operate in line with this, so that they are then aligned with the ITIL approach. The Resource Trouble Management processes respond immediately to any issues that may affect the operation of a resource, including events, and ITIL Event Management works with this process to resolve events related to a resource.
