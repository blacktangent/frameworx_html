	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>The purpose of the Track & Manage Service Problem processes is to ensure that testing, repair and restoration activities are assigned, coordinated and tracked efficiently, and that escalation is invoked as required for any open service trouble reports in jeopardy.Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:• Initiating first-in testing using automated remote testing capabilities;• Adding additional information to an open service trouble report based on the first-in testing;• Scheduling, assigning and coordinating repair and restoration activities;• Generating the respective resource trouble report creation request(s) to Create Resource Trouble Report based on specific service trouble reports;• Initiate any final testing to confirm clearance of the service problem;• Undertake necessary tracking of the execution progress;• Modifying information in an existing service trouble report based on assignments;• Modifying the service trouble report status;• Canceling a service trouble report when the specific problem was related to a false service alarm event• Monitoring the jeopardy status of open service trouble reports, and escalating service trouble reports as necessary.Note that some specific resource components may be owned and managed by other parties.  In these cases the Track & Manage Service Problem process is responsible for initiating requests, through Party Problem Handling processes for restoration and recovery by the  party related to the specific resource components.These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence.The Track & Manage Service Problem processes are responsible for engaging external parties in correction and recovery activities when:• higher level expertise and/or higher level support is required to resolve the service problem, (which may be automatic in the case of highest priority service problems);• the specific service has been purchased from an external party (as in an interconnect service).• the specific service is delivered by an external party.Where the engagement with an external party is for purchased or delivered services, as the case may be, the tracking and management of the party problem resolution activity is actually performed by the Party Problem Handling processes, with the Track & Manage Service Problem processes relegated to an overall coordination role. The Track & Manage Service Problem processes will also inform the Close Service Problem processes by modifying the service trouble report status to cleared when the service problem has been resolved.

	<p>The purpose of the Track & Manage Service Problem processes is to ensure that testing, repair and restoration activities are assigned, coordinated and tracked efficiently, and that escalation is invoked as required for any open service trouble reports in jeopardy. 
In linking with ITIL, note that the relationship here with the underlying "service" is not so distinct in ITIL, as there "service" is used to address also the "product" focus here.

	<h3>Candidate Mandatory</h3>

                <p>Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
· Initiating first-in testing using automated remote testing capabilities;
· Adding additional information to an open service trouble report based on the first-in testing;
· Scheduling, assigning and coordinating repair and restoration activities;
· Generating the respective resource trouble report creation request(s) to Create Resource Trouble Report based on specific service trouble reports;
· Initiate any final testing to confirm clearance of the service problem;
· Undertake necessary tracking of the execution progress;
· Modifying information in an existing service trouble report based on assignments;
· Modifying the service trouble report status;
· Canceling a service trouble report when the specific problem was related to a false service alarm event; and
· Monitoring the jeopardy status of open service trouble reports, and escalating service trouble reports as necessary.

These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence.

The Track & Manage Service Problem processes are responsible for engaging external suppliers/partners in correction and recovery activities when:
· higher level expertise and/or higher level support is required to resolve the service problem, (which may be automatic in the case of highest priority service problems);
· the specific service has been purchased from an external supplier (as in an interconnect service); or
· the specific service is delivered by an external partner.

                <h3>Candidate Optional</h3>
              
	<p>Reserved for future use.

	<h3>Candidate Interactions</h3>

                <p>Note that some specific resource components may be owned and managed by suppliers/partners.  In these cases the Track & Manage Service Problem process is responsible for initiating requests, through S/P Problem Reporting & Management processes for restoration and recovery by the supplier/partner of the specific resource components. 

Where the engagement with an external supplier/partner is for purchased or delivered services, as the case may be, the tracking and management of the supplier/partner problem resolution activity is actually performed by the S/P Problem Reporting & Management processes, with the Track & Manage Service Problem processes relegated to an overall coordination role. The Track & Manage Service Problem processes will also inform the Close Service Problem processes by modifying the service trouble report status to cleared when the service problem has been resolved.
