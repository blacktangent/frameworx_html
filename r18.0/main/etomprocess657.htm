	<h3>Description</h3>
              
	<p>Request Fulfillment is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Request Fulfillment (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Request Fulfillment is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Request Fulfillment (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.ITIL Request Fulfillment ensures that Service Requests are fulfilled in a controlled and timely manner, most of these service requests are actually changes to the service but due to the small scale impact and frequency it makes sense to take them out of the change management process.  The models used for request fulfillment must be signed off by change management before they are used to ensure that there are no risks to the service or environment by implementing them.•Terminology•Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.From the eTOM perspective, each service request is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, a service request created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Service Request  etc. In addition, service requests are not constrained to the Fulfillment vertical in the Operations part of eTOM. They can also be found in other verticals such as problem handling in the assurance vertical or bill inquiry handling in the billing vertical.From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM.Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc.For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are handled in this process.In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.•Linkage with eTOM process areas•ITIL Request Fulfilment affects the following eTOM process areas:Within Operations:Process Identifier: 1.1.1Process Element: Customer Relationship ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer Relationship Management processes operate in line with this. The affected processes are:Customer-Ops Support & ReadinessCustomer Interface ManagementOrder HandlingProblem HandlingBilling Inquiry HandlingProcess Identifier: 1.1.1.1Process Element: Customer-Ops Support & ReadinessProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Support & Readiness processes operate in line with this. Process Identifier: 1.1.1.2Process Element: Customer Interface ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer Interface Management processes operate in line with this. Process Identifier: 1.1.1.5Process Element: Order HandlingProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Order Handling processes operate in line with this. Process Identifier: 1.1.1.6Process Element: Problem HandlingProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Problem Handling processes operate in line with this.  Process Identifier: 1.1.1.12Process Element: Billing Inquiry HandlingProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Billing Inquiry Handling processes operate in line with this. Process Identifier: 1.1.2Process Element: Service Management & OperationsProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Management & Operations processes operate in line with this. The affected process is:Service Configuration & ActivationProcess Identifier: 1.1.2.2Process Element: Service Configuration & ActivationProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Configuration & Activation processes operate in line with this.Process Identifier: 1.1.3Process Element: Resource Management & OperationsProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Management & Operations processes operate in line with this. The affected process is:Resource ProvisioningProcess Identifier: 1.1.3.2Process Element: Resource ProvisioningProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Provisioning processes operate in line with this.Process domain: Engaged Party Process Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the processes of the Engaged Party operate in line with this. The affected processes are: Party Order Handling , Party Interface ManagementProcess Element: Party Order HandlingProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Party Order Handling  processes operate in line with this.Process Element: Party  Interface ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Request Fulfilment is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Party Interface Management processes operate in line with this.Process Identifier: 1.3.3Process Element: Enterprise Effectiveness ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Problem Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Effectiveness Management processes operate in line with this. Additionally, new ITIL references are proposed as L2 eTOM processes. These are:ITIL Request FulfilmentProcess Identifier: 1.3.3.xProcess Element: ITIL Request FulfilmentProcess Impact:This new process in eTOM should reference the corresponding detailed process in ITIL documentation.
