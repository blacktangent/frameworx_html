                <p>The Enable Service Configuration & Activation processes are responsible for planning and deployment of service infrastructure, and for ensuring availability of sufficient service infrastructure to support the Service Configuration & Activation processes. The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:• forecasting at an operational level service infrastructure volume requirements and run-out timeframes;• the capacity planning associated with the deployment of new and/or modified service infrastructure;• establishment and monitoring of organizational arrangements to support deployment and operation of new and/or modified service infrastructure;• creation, deployment, modification and/or upgrading of service infrastructure deployment support tools (including Service Inventory) and processes for new and/or modified service infrastructure; • development and promulgation of service infrastructure capacity deployment rules and controls;• authoring, reviewing and approving operational procedures developed by Service Development & Management processes prior to service infrastructure deployment;• the testing and acceptance of new and/or modified service infrastructure as part of the handover procedure from the Service Development & Management processes to Operations;• detecting service infrastructure operational limitations and/or deployment incompatibilities and providing requirements to address these aspects to Service Development & Management processes;• co-ordination and roll-out, in accordance with approved plans, of the approved new and/or modified service infrastructure;• monitoring capacity utilization of deployed service infrastructure to provide early detection of potential service infrastructure shortfalls; • reconfiguration and re-arrangement of under-utilized deployed service infrastructure;• managing recovery and/or removal of obsolete or unviable service infrastructure;• reporting on deployed service infrastructure capacity;• Tracking and monitoring of the service infrastructure deployment processes and costs (including where service infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties), and reporting on the capability of the service infrastructure deployment processes; • establishing and managing service provisioning notification facilities and lists to support the Service Configuration & Activation notification and reporting processes• updating the Service Inventory of any changes to the available service infrastructure capacity.

                <p>The Enable Service Configuration & Activation processes are responsible for planning and deployment of service infrastructure, and for ensuring availability of sufficient service infrastructure to support the Service Configuration & Activation processes. 
The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
· forecasting at an operational level service infrastructure volume requirements and run-out timeframes;
· the capacity planning associated with the deployment of new and/or modified service infrastructure;
· establishment and monitoring of organizational arrangements to support deployment and operation of new and/or modified service infrastructure;
· creation, deployment, modification and/or upgrading of service infrastructure deployment support tools (including Service Inventory) and processes for new and/or modified service infrastructure;
 · development and promulgation of service infrastructure capacity deployment rules and controls;
· authoring, reviewing and approving operational procedures developed by Service Development & Management processes prior to service infrastructure deployment;
· the testing and acceptance of new and/or modified service infrastructure as part of the handover procedure from the Service Development & Management processes to Operations;
· detecting service infrastructure operational limitations and/or deployment incompatibilities and providing requirements to address these aspects to Service Development & Management processes;
· co-ordination and roll-out, in accordance with approved plans, of the approved new and/or modified service infrastructure;
· monitoring capacity utilization of deployed service infrastructure to provide early detection of potential service infrastructure shortfalls; 
· reconfiguration and re-arrangement of under-utilized deployed service infrastructure;
· managing recovery and/or removal of obsolete or unviable service infrastructure;
· reporting on deployed service infrastructure capacity;
· Tracking and monitoring of the service infrastructure deployment processes and costs (including where service infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties), and reporting on the capability of the service infrastructure deployment processes;
 · establishing and managing service provisioning notification facilities and lists to support the Service Configuration & Activation notification and reporting processes; and
· updating the Service Inventory of any changes to the available service infrastructure capacity.
