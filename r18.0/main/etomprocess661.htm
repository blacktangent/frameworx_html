	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx ,Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for CSI (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.Continual Service Improvement represents pro-active mechanisms to help an organization to improve and realize benefits in terms of ROI (return on investment) and VOI (value on investment) along with intangible benefits of customer and staff satisfaction increasing. Note that while there may be a central focus for CSI within an organization, typically the activities to improve should form part of everyone’s roles.  Everyone within the organization needs to be empowered to suggest improvement ideas and those who actually run the processes or areas of business affected by an Improvement activity should be expected to implement the solutions.•Terminology•The use of “Service” in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise’s customers) will map to Product.•Linkage with eTOM process areas•Process Identifier: 1.3.3Process Element: Enterprise Effectiveness ManagementProcess Impact: The Enterprise Effectiveness Management process grouping focuses on defining and providing the tools, methodologies and training to ensure that the enterprise processes and activities are managed and run efficiently and effectively, and can manage this in line with the ITIL context of Continual Service Improvement (CSI), where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned.Process Identifier: 1.3.3.1Process Element: Process Management & SupportProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Process Management & Support processes operate in line with this, so that process design, change, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.In ITIL Continual Service Improvement, the intent is that all parts of an enterprise seek to improve services and service management processes, based on formalizing and documenting process responsibilities and ownership, and suitable metrics to measure and evaluate the services concerned, including the relationship with underlying technologies, etc., as well as the processes involved. ITIL Continual Service Improvement aims to review, analyze and recommend improvements in all these areas, with the overall goal of improving both cost effectiveness for the services concerned and the customer satisfaction of the service users. The general role of the Process Management & Support processes is consistent with these goals, and ITIL Continual Service Improvement acts to focus how these Process Management & Support operate, and to provide requirements for this.Process Identifier: 1.3.3.2Process Element: Enterprise Quality ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Quality Management processes operate within this, so that quality management policies and how these are applied throughout the Enterprise are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.3.3.4Process Element: Enterprise Performance AssessmentProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Performance Assessment processes operate in line with this, so that process monitoring and assessment, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5Process Element: Product & Offer Development & RetirementProcess Impact:Product Development & Retirement processes also manage major product and service updates and enhancement, and can manage this in line with the ITIL context of Continual Service Improvement (CSI), where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.1Process Element: Gather & Analyze New Product IdeasProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Gather & Analyze New Product Ideas processes operate within this, so that analysis of product and service updates and enhancement, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.2Process Element: Assess Performance of Existing ProductsProcess Impact:Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Assess Performance of Existing Products processes operate in line with this, so that product performance analysis and assessment, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.3Process Element: Develop New Product Business ProposalProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Develop New Product Business Proposal processes operate in line with this, so that proposals for product and service updates and enhancement, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.5Process Element: Develop Detailed Product SpecificationsProcess Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Develop Detailed Product Specifications processes operate in line with this, so that specification of product and service updates and enhancement, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.6Process Element: Assess Performance of Existing ProductsProcess Impact: Manage Product DevelopmentWhere ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Manage Product Development processes operate in line with this, so that development of product and service updates and enhancement, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.
