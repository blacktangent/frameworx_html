Full flow-through integration of applications at an enterprise level is a very significant task and one that many industry sectors have been trying to perfect over many years. In the communications industry, some degree of application integration has been achieved over the past decade, but this typically has consisted on system-system point integration to achieve a specific, high volume flow-through result. The reality of this approach is that it can work but it is very expensive and very inflexible, requiring programmatic changes every time a minor process change is needed. The enterprise integration applications described in this document seek to provide an effective, generic and flexible approach to such integration where changes can be made by operations people rather than software engineers. <o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 0in" class=BodyTextKeep><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>It is critical to the success of any ‘lean operator’ program that integration between<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>processes, data and applications can be achieved progressively, accommodating both legacy applications as well as new systems sourced from commercial suppliers or built in-house. Some approaches to integration are really only applicable to ‘clean-build situations and for most operators with legacy systems, it is most unlikely that they can deploy anything other than step-by-step progressive integration approach. This progressive approach assumes that an increasing number of steps in a lean operator’s processes will be automated via applications, either by replacement of current manual process steps, replacement of existing applications with one’s offering greater functionality or upgrades to existing systems. Thus the task of providing end-to-end, flexible process automation is essentially one of providing integration between “islands” of automation.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 0in" class=BodyTextKeep><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>There are 3 primary building blocks to achieving a generic and flexible approach to integration such process and application “islands”.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These are:<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 0in" class=BodyTextKeep><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>A common communications infrastructure between each application. Several leading middleware products are now well established to provide a common communications vehicle. The most common of these is currently enterprise application integration (EAI) bus technology that supports numerous interface types to cater for a variety of legacy operating systems, databases, data formats, standards etc. EAI is concerned foremost with application-to-application exchange of data, not user activity or interaction. A business process management (BPM) environment. BPM is an emerging class of technologies that work hand-in–hand with EAI technology to provide a range of facilities to manage process and information flows between applications. The real value of BPM is the ability to define and execute business processes independent of applications and infrastructure. While EAI and integration capabilities offer an important resource to BPM environments, EAI software alone typically lacks the ability to address the user-facing side of business processes. <o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in; tab-stops: 0in" class=BodyTextKeep><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2>Business Services defined interfaces between applications.
