&lt;P&gt;This horizontal functional process grouping maintains knowledge of resources 
(application, computing and network infrastructures) and is responsible for 
managing all these resources (e.g. networks, IT systems, servers, routers, etc.) 
utilized to deliver and support services required by or proposed to customers. 
It also includes all functionalities responsible for the direct management of 
all such resources (network elements, computers, servers, etc.) utilized within 
the enterprise. These processes are responsible for ensuring that the network 
and information technologies infrastructure supports the end-to-end delivery of 
the required services. The purpose of these processes is to ensure that 
infrastructure runs smoothly, is accessible to services and employees, is 
maintained and is responsive to the needs, whether directly or indirectly, of 
services, customers and employees. RM&amp;amp;O also has the basic function to 
assemble information about the resources (e.g. from network elements and/or 
element management systems), and then integrate, correlate, and in many cases, 
summarize that data to pass on the relevant information to Service Management 
systems, or to take action in the appropriate resource.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In an ebusiness world, application and computing management are as important 
as management of the network resources. Moreover, network, computing and 
applications resources must increasingly be managed in a joint and integrated 
fashion. To cope with these needs, the Business Process Framework framework includes the Resource 
Management &amp;amp; Operations process grouping (together with the corresponding 
Resource Development &amp;amp; Management grouping within SIP), to provide 
integrated management across these three sets of resources: applications, 
computing and network. These areas also encompass processes involved with 
traditional Network Element Management, since these processes are actually 
critical components of any resource management process, as opposed to a separate 
process layer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The RM&amp;amp;O processes thus manage the complete service provider network and 
sub-network and information technology infrastructures.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Business Process Framework framework differentiates day-to-day operations and support from 
planning and development, and other strategy and lifecycle processes. This 
better depicts the structure of an enterprise, especially in an ebusiness 
era.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;"></P>
