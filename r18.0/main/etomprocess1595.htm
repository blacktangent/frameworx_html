	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>A Work Order is an aggregation of jobs that are to be completed to achieve some business goal: to provide a customer service, to fix a problem, etc. Work Order Lifecycle Management processes are responsible for processing and monitoring the execution of a work order through its entire lifecycle, from issuance to closing. This includes, among other steps, validation, analysis, and decomposing a work order into work items, aggregating them, and assigning them to employees and/or third parties. These processes also detect problems with completing the work, and requesting Work Order reassignment to reallocate manual activities to solve the issue.It should be noted that the Work Order execution sub process (by a field technician) is not explicitly covered here, but rather its monitoring is the responsibility of the Track and Manage work order sub process.
