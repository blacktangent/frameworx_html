	<p>The purpose of the Track & Manage Customer Problem processes is to ensure that recovery activities are assigned, coordinated and tracked efficiently, and that escalation is invoked as required for any open customer problem reports in jeopardy. 
Note that "customer problem" is here being used for a specific diificulty experienced by a customer, which may have been raised by the customer, or by other analysis triggered by events or issues identified elsewhere (e.g. through fault notifications from affected resources). In linking with ITIL, this relates to ITIL's "incident" more strongly than with ITIL's "problem" which there is associated with some wider issue where the "problem" has been escalated because individual incidents that are seen as related to this problem cannot be resolved , or because a number of incidents are being investigated to see if there is a common underlying problem for these.

	<h3>Candidate Mandatory</h3>

                <p>Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to
· Scheduling, assigning and coordinating tracking any recovery activities, and any repair and restoration activities delegated to other processes;
· Generating the respective service trouble report creation request(s) to Create Service Trouble Report based on specific customer problem reports;
· Undertake necessary tracking of the execution progress;
· Modifying information in an existing customer problem report based on assignments;
· Modifying the customer problem report status;
· Canceling a customer problem report when the specific problem was related to an incorrect customer problem report; and
· Monitoring the jeopardy status of open customer problem reports, and escalating customer problem reports as necessary.

Note that some specific product and/or service components may be owned and managed by suppliers/partners. In these cases the Track & Manage Customer Problem process is responsible for initiating requests, through S/P Problem Reporting & Management processes for restoration and recovery by the supplier/partner of the specific service components. These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence. The Track & Manage Customer Problem processes will also inform the Close Customer Problem processes by modifying the customer problem report status to cleared when the customer problem has been resolved.
