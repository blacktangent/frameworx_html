It will then analyze the resource alarm events based on a number of criteria and then suppress redundant, transient or implied resource alarm events by means of filtering and correlation. It includes the notification of new resource alarm event records, or status changes of previously reported resource alarm event records, as well as abatement messages when resource alarm event records have been cleared.The analysis will correlate resource alarm event notifications to planned outage notifications to remove false resource alarm event notifications arising as a result of the planned outage activity.These processes may determine that a resource alarm event notification may represent a service impacting condition. In these circumstances this process is responsible for indicating a potential service problem to the Service Problem Management processes.
