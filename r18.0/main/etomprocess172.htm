                <p>The responsibilities of the Support Customer QoS/SLA Management processes are twofold - support Customer QoS/SLA Management processes by proactively monitoring and assessing the performance of purchased product offerings as a group against agreed QoS/SLA parameters, and monitoring, managing and reporting on the capability of the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes.
Proactive management is undertaken using a range of performance parameters, whether technical, time, economic or process related. 
The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to:
· Undertaking proactive monitoring regimes of groups of similar purchased product offerings as required to ensure ongoing performance within agreed parameters over  time;
· Developing and maintaining, in the product offering  repository, acceptable and/or commercially agreed performance threshold standards for purchased product offerings to support the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes;
· Undertaking trend analysis, and producing reports, of the QoS performance of groups of like purchased product offerings to identify any longer term deterioration;
· Monitoring and analyzing the purchased product offering performance analyses produced by the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes to identify problems that may be applicable to purchased product offerings as a whole;
· Aggregate analysis of QoS performance across groups of customers or aggregate analysis of SLA types;
· Sourcing details relating to purchased product offerings performance and analysis from the product offering inventory to assist in the development of trend analyses;
· Logging the results of the analysis into the product offering inventory repository;· Establishing and managing facilities to inform customers of, and negotiate agreement for, planned service outages;
· Tracking and monitoring of the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes and associated costs, and reporting on the capability of the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes;
 · Establishing and managing customer notification facilities and lists to support the Customer QoS/SLA Management notification and reporting processes; and
· Supporting the Support Customer QoS/SLA Management process.
