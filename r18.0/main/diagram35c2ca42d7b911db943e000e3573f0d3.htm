A key input to the resource strategy arises from the enterprise’s market, product portfolio and service strategy and forecasts.

These processes deliver and develop annual and multi-year resource plans in support of services, products and offers that include volume forecasts, negotiation for required levels of resources, gaining resource development and management as well as supply chain commitment and executive approval for the plans.
Forecasting of resource demand, and capturing of new opportunities, are both essential to ensure that the enterprise can construct and implement the resources necessary for the future needs of their customers and potential customers.
These processes define the resource implementation standards sought, key new resource capabilities required, resource support levels and approaches required, resource design elements to be developed, as well as resource cost parameters and targets. These processes also define the policies relating to technical resources and their implementation."></P>
