§	Classifying different types of manual activities, including association with required skill sets and job code descriptions
§	Managing work order specifications and their structure filled with sequences of dependent work items. A work order can be decomposed into elementary parts that can be completed by different people in different places and at different times. These elementary pieces of work are called work items.
§	Managing individual technicians, allocating them to various workforce groups (workforce pools, crews, etc.) and associating them with aggregations of skills they possess, locations they cover, etc. This also includes potential &quot;borrowing&quot; of staff from one group to another.
§	Establishing and managing organization lists, containing organizational charts, serving area covered, etc.
§	Consolidating employee and/or third-party working hours on a specific timeframe basis (day, week, month) including management of various types of events; providing this information to the Financial Management process for generating payroll and/or to the S/P Settlement &amp; Payments Management process for paying third parties.
§	Enabling and managing recall capabilities to allow for out-of-hours staff recall in the event of unforeseen circumstances
§	Administering the appointment schedule, including the hours of operation of the schedule, number of appointments allowed within a certain time block, etc.
§	Setting up and configuring the information transfer and integration with third-party systems"></P>
