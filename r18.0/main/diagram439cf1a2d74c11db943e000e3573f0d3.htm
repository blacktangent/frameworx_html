These processes support the categorization and prioritization of areas of revenue leakage risk. To achieve this, these processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and procedures to be followed and provide assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate procedures and monitoring capabilities.
Revenue Assurance Management processes deal with the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operation activity, analysis of monitored activity to detect and correct actual revenue leakage. These processes work in conjunction with operational and other process elements to guide them in supporting the specific needs of Revenue Assurance Management. Where appropriate, Revenue Assurance Management processes supplement the capabilities of these other process elements, to control and analyze the enterprise behavior relevant to Revenue Assurance needs,
The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
·	Establishing and managing a revenue assurance policy framework, including identification of controls and measures
·	Establishing and managing an operational process capability able to detect and resolve revenue assurance degradations and violations
·	Establishing and managing a capacity to regularly review the revenue assurance policy framework to ensure it meets the enterprise’s changing objectives."></P>
