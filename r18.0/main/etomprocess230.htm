                <p>The responsibilities of the Enable Resource Performance Management processes are twofold - support Resource Performance Management processes by proactively monitoring and assessing resource infrastructure performance, and monitoring, managing and reporting on the capability of the Resource Performance Management processes.

Proactive management is undertaken using a range of performance parameters, whether technical, time, economic or process related. 

The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to:

· Undertaking proactive monitoring regimes of resource infrastructure as required to ensure ongoing performance within agreed parameters over time;
· Developing and maintaining a repository of acceptable performance threshold standards for resource instances to support the Resource Performance Management processes;
· Undertaking trend analysis, and producing reports, of the performance of resource infrastructure to identify any longer term deterioration;
· Monitoring and analyzing the resource instance analyses produced by the Resource Performance Management processes to identify problems that may be applicable to the resource infrastructure as a whole;
· Sourcing details relating to resource instance performance and analysis from the resource inventory to assist in the development of trend analyses;
· Logging the results of the analysis into the resource inventory repository;
· Establishing and managing resource performance data collection schedules, including managing the collection of the necessary information from the Resource Data Collection & Distribution processes, to support proactive monitoring and analysis activity, and requests from Resource Performance 

Management processes for additional data to support resource instance performance analysis;
· Establishing and managing facilities to support management of planned resource infrastructure and resource instance outages;
· Establishing, maintaining and managing the testing of resource performance control plans to cater for anticipated resource performance disruptions;
· Proactively triggering the instantiation of control plans to manage performance through programmed and/or foreseen potentially disruptive events, i.e. anticipated traffic loads on Xmas day, planned outages, etc.;
· Tracking and monitoring of the Resource Performance Management processes and associated costs (including where resource infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties), and reporting on the capability of the Resource Performance Management processes;
 · Establishing and managing resource performance notification facilities and lists to support the Resource Performance Management notification and reporting processes; and
· Supporting the Support Service Quality Management process.

Interactions with other processes include, but are not limited to:

· Developing and maintaining a repository of acceptable performance threshold standards for resource instances to support the Resource Performance Management processes;
