                <p>The responsibilities of the Enable Service Quality Management processes are twofold -support Service Quality Management processes by proactively monitoring and assessing service infrastructure performance, and monitoring, managing and reporting on the capability of the Service Quality Management processes.Proactive management is undertaken using a range of performance parameters, whether technical, time, economic or process related. The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to:• Undertaking proactive monitoring regimes of service infrastructure as required to ensure ongoing performance within agreed parameters over time;• Developing and maintaining a repository of acceptable performance threshold standards for service instances to support the Service Quality Management processes;• Undertaking trend analysis, and producing reports, of the performance of service infrastructure to identify any longer term deterioration;• Monitoring and analyzing the service instance analyses produced by the Service Quality Management processes to identify problems that may be applicable to the service infrastructure as a whole;• Sourcing details relating to service instance performance and analysis from the service inventory to assist in the development of trend analyses;• Logging the results of the analysis into the service inventory repository;• Establishing and managing service quality data collection schedules, including managing the collection of the necessary information from the Resource Data Collection & Distribution processes, to support proactive monitoring and analysis activity, and requests from Service Quality Management processes for additional data to support service instance performance analysis;• Establishing and managing facilities to support management of planned service infrastructure and service instance outages;• Establishing, maintaining and managing the testing of Service Quality control plans to cater for anticipated service quality disruptions;• Proactively triggering the instantiation of control plans to manage performance through programmed and/or foreseen potentially disruptive events, i.e. anticipated traffic loads on Xmas day, planned outages, etc.;• Tracking and monitoring of the Service Quality Management processes and associated costs (including where service infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties), and reporting on the capability of the Service Quality Management processes; • Establishing and managing service quality notification facilities and lists to support the Service Quality Management notification and reporting processes• Supporting the Support Customer QoS/SLA Management process.

                <p>The responsibilities of the Enable Service Quality Management processes are twofold -support Service Quality Management processes by proactively monitoring and assessing service infrastructure performance, and monitoring, managing and reporting on the capability of the Service Quality Management processes.
Proactive management is undertaken using a range of performance parameters, whether technical, time, economic or process related. 
The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to:
· Undertaking proactive monitoring regimes of service infrastructure as required to ensure ongoing performance within agreed parameters over time;
· Developing and maintaining a repository of acceptable performance threshold standards for service instances to support the Service Quality Management processes;
· Undertaking trend analysis, and producing reports, of the performance of service infrastructure to identify any longer term deterioration;
· Monitoring and analyzing the service instance analyses produced by the Service Quality Management processes to identify problems that may be applicable to the service infrastructure as a whole;
· Sourcing details relating to service instance performance and analysis from the service inventory to assist in the development of trend analyses;
· Logging the results of the analysis into the service inventory repository;
· Establishing and managing service quality data collection schedules, including managing the collection of the necessary information from the Resource Data Collection & Distribution processes, to support proactive monitoring and analysis activity, and requests from Service Quality Management processes for additional data to support service instance performance analysis;
· Establishing and managing facilities to support management of planned service infrastructure and service instance outages;
· Establishing, maintaining and managing the testing of Service Quality control plans to cater for anticipated service quality disruptions;
· Proactively triggering the instantiation of control plans to manage performance through programmed and/or foreseen potentially disruptive events, i.e. anticipated traffic loads on Xmas day, planned outages, etc.;
· Tracking and monitoring of the Service Quality Management processes and associated costs (including where service infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties), and reporting on the capability of the Service Quality Management processes;
 · Establishing and managing service quality notification facilities and lists to support the Service Quality Management notification and reporting processes; and
· Supporting the Support Customer QoS/SLA Management process.

	<h3>Candidate Interactions</h3>

                <p>The responsibilities of the Enable Service Quality Management processes involve monitoring, managing and reporting on the capability of the Service Quality Management processes.

The interactions  with other processes include, but are not limited to:
· Developing and maintaining a repository of acceptable performance threshold standards for service instances to support the Service Quality Management processes;
· Monitoring and analyzing the service instance analyses produced by the Service Quality Management processes to identify problems that may be applicable to the service infrastructure as a whole;
