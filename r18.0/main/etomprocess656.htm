	<h3>Extended Description</h3>

                <p>Incident Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspxIts role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Incident Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.The purpose of Incident Management is to restore normal service as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on the day to day running of the business.  An incident is either something which has had an effect on service or something which may have an effect in the future.Incident Management represents….. text to be developed•Terminology•Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each takes of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.From the eTOM perspective, each incident is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, an incident created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Incident, etc. (Similarly, this qualification by layer is applied to the identification of the underlying problem. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as an Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.)From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.•Linkage with eTOM process areas•ITIL Incident Management relates to several eTOM process areas.  The eTOM processes affected includeWithin Operations: Process Identifier: 1.1.1Process Element: Customer Relationship ManagementProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer Relationship Management processes operate in line with this. The affected processes are:Customer-Ops Support & ReadinessCustomer Interface ManagementProblem HandlingRetention & loyaltyProcess Identifier: 1.1.1.1Process Element: Customer-Ops Support & ReadinessProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Support & Readiness processes operate in line with this, so that infrastructure provision, management and analysis, decision support, inventory and stock monitoring and review, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach.In ITIL Incident Management, the Incident Logging step will make use of the infrastructure to support customer interaction for the Assurance process. Specifically, using the Customer Inventory to identify the ITIL CI.Process Identifier: 1.1.1.2Process Element: Customer-Ops Interface Management Process Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Interface Management processes operate in line with this, so that customer contact, links with Assurance/Helpdesk, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach. In ITIL Incident Management, the Incident Logging step will use the Customer Interface Management processes to manage the contact between the user and the ITIL Service Desk.Process Identifier: 1.1.1.6Process Element: Problem HandlingProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Problem Handling processes operate in line with this, so that processing of incidents related to complaints or faults, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach. In ITIL Incident Management, the steps for Incident Logging, Incident Categorization, Incident Prioritization and Initial Diagnosis will use the Problem Handling processes for the Customer or Customer-Ops point of view of the ITIL Incident. These processes include capture and analysis of the incident, initiating the ITIL Incident Record, and its closure. Process Identifier: 1.1.1.9Process Element: Retention & LoyaltyProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Retention & Loyalty processes operate in line with this, so that the handling and assessment of customer impact from incidents, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach. In ITIL Incident Management, at the Incident Closure step, the Service Desk will check that the incident is fully resolved and that the users are satisfied and willing to agree that the ITIL incident can be closed. The Retention & Loyalty process collects and analyzes data from all enterprise and customer contact, including the ITIL User Satisfaction Survey.Process Identifier: 1.1.2Process Element: Service Management & OperationsProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Management & Operations processes operate in line with this. The affected processes are:Service Problem ManagementProcess Identifier: 1.1.3Process Element: Resource Management & OperationsProcess Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource Management & Operations processes operate in line with this. The affected processes are:Resource Trouble ManagementProcess Domain: Engaged Party :Process Impact: Processes from the Engaged Party Domain :processes operate in line with this. The affected processes are:Party Problem Handling
