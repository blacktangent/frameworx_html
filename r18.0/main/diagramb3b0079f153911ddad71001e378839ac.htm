&lt;P&gt;Resource Domain Management is the application area that provides the exposed 
resource services that are available to all other application areas, including 
those others in the Resource Management layer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Domain Management’s role in Next Generation Network re-engineering is to hide 
the idiosyncrasies and shortcomings of the Network, IT Computing, and IT 
applications equipment from the rest of the OSS estate, freeing it to be agile. 
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is particularly important as operators install lots of new, untried 
equipment with early release Element Management software.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Resource Domain Managers should be expert activators, alarm handlers, and 
billing mediators for their domain, but should not operate in any cross-domain 
capacity. It is the responsibility of the other Resource Management layer 
applications to perform any cross-domain functions such as forecasting, capacity 
planning and design, and or for co-coordinating activation, root cause analysis 
and performance monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The basic model is shown below and is related to the examples shown in 
section 4.2 TMF 516.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Relationship of Resource Domain Management to other Application Map application 
areas&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;Why Domain Management?&lt;/B&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Domains are defined as a set of entities, in this case resources, which have 
a common set of policies applied to them by a manager (M. Sloman, &quot;Policy Driven 
Management for Distributed Systems,&quot; &lt;I&gt;J. Net. Sys. Mgmt.&lt;/I&gt;, vol. 2, no. 4, 
1994, pp. 333–60). Note that the general concept of a Domain allows for 
overlapping Domains, provided there are no policy conflicts. However it is 
likely that the Application Map will need to mandate non-overlapping Resource Domains.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The resources that need to be managed include: IT computing, IT application, 
and networks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Historically Networks have been managed as a service technology specific 
stove pipe such as SDH and ATM i.e. the service providers have commonly imposed 
a policy that all SDH services will be managed by one management systems stack. 
In next generation networks there is a need to move away from stovepipe E2E 
service management stacks towards a shared resource infrastructure model for 
services.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;TMF 516 SoIP Resource Management Business Agreement suggests that 
NGN will need to introduce a set of patterns for managing resources. It 
identified in section 2.6 three dimensions for patterns namely, Protocol, 
Functional and Network and covered the general requirements for IT computing, IT 
application, networks resources. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A specific example in TMF516 for Networks was the proposal to use Resource 
Management Domains that separately manage the logical and physical aspects 
of:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Access Networks&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Access Nodes&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Intelligence Nodes&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Core Network&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Gateway Nodes&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Applications and Content Servers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;"></P>
