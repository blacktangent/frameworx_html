Customer interactions may be short lived ( such as in the case of  a query that is answered immediately ) or may take long time to complete (such as in the case of complex orders or requests concerning back office intervention). When interactions are long the process is in charge of making sure the customer is notified in a timely manner about the progress of her request.
